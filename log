Notes / progress / log of what was actually done

- setup vscode etc
- decided to first do a simple shell script with a call to the rest api but it seems like there's only a graphql api now
- trying to figure out what stop codes visible in physical stops are called in the api 
- graphiql is such a nice tool
- glossary doesn't have any info on the Hxxxx stop codes, so I'll just skip that and manually figure out the first stop codes to get started
.. or then note because I can just use that in the name field of a query, it seems to be called a code but also works in name so whatever
- cool the api can be run locally
- since no rest, i'll also skip the shell phase and just create a small app
- have not touched any of this since ~nightingale, will just furiously copy-paste sensible-looking stuff and work from there with a create-react-app basis
