Notes / progress / log of what was actually done

TO 

12:00 
- setup vscode, github, planning etc
- decided to first do a simple shell script with a call to the rest api but it seems like there's only a graphql api now
- trying to figure out what stop codes visible in physical stops are called in the api 
- graphiql is such a nice tool
- glossary doesn't have any info on the Hxxxx stop codes, so I'll just skip that and manually figure out the first stop codes to get started
.. or then note because I can just use that in the name field of a query, it seems to be called a code but also works in name so whatever
- cool the api can be run locally
- since no rest, i'll also skip the shell phase and just create a small app
- have not touched any of this since ~nightingale, will just furiously copy-paste sensible-looking stuff and work from there with a create-react-app basis
- docker service on lakannut toimimasta, debugataan sitä sitten
- reboot...
- graphql-request näyttää sopivan simppeliltä työkalulta ja löyty oikea kontti apin ajamiselle lokaalisti
16:00 kauppaan
17:00 
- docker fixed, can run the graphql server locally now
- small typescript piece works now for getting a stop with Hcode
- reading docs for fuller api descriptions; what I initally thought to be very straightforward, seems to be slightly more complex and I want to understand a good way to get what I want (doesn't need to be the best way but at least somehow sensible); I had initially thought stops are the interesting thing but probably in this API trip/route is a more sensible starting point; gathering trips for certain buses/trains and picking the correct stop for them
- now I need to refresh grahql a bit 
- can't be bothered to fix ts errors at this point
- parsing also still left for the simple part
20;30
- now just playing around with graphiql

i probably have the query i want

8:30
- basic stuff works but everything is ugly and types are missing, I wonder how long it will take for me to write the types, I am so very rusty
