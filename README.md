# playground

## What

1. A simple app showing the next means of transport aggreate from pre-defined stops 
2. Personal playground for learning/trying out new things.


For personal needs, a simple app with CLI would be enough, but for learning purposes I will overengineer - maybe a lot!

See [roadmap](roadmap.md) for progress and plans.

## Why

When multiple different buses/trains could take you where you're going but they don't leave from the same stop, you have two options

* check each stop/bus individually
* use reittiopas

The first option is tedious and will also show buses that are irrelevant for getting to A, the second may well opt not to show you some actually available options.
