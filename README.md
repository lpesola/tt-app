# playground

## What

Personal playground for learning/trying out new things. 

A simple app showing the next means of transport aggreate from pre-defined stops. 

See [roadmap](roadmap.md) for progress and plans.

## Why

When you have multiple options for buses to get to place A but all of them leave from different stops, you have two options

* check each stop/bus individually
* use reittiopas

The first option is tedious and will also show buses that are irrelevant for getting to A, the second may well opt not to show you some actually available options.
