# playground

## What

1. A simple app showing the next available transport options from selected stops/lines
2. Personal playground for learning/trying out new things.

For personal needs, a simple app with CLI would be enough, but for learning purposes I'll try to overengineer

See [roadmap](roadmap.md) for progress, plans, and ideas.

## Why

When you have multiple options for getting where you want to go, all leaving from different stops, you have two options

* check each stop/bus individually
* use reittiopas

The first option is tedious and includes superfluous information, the second may well opt to not show you all available options
