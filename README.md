# Next departures

## What

1. A simple app showing the next available transport options from selected stops/lines
2. Playground for learning

This is for my personal use, so some choices might be quirky or less-than-polished.
A simple CLI app would be quite enough for that, but for learning purposes I might do some silly overengineering.

See [ideas.md](ideas.md) for progress, plans, and ideas.

## Why

When you have multiple options for getting where you want to go, all leaving from different stops, you have two options

- check each stop/bus individually
- use reittiopas

The first option is tedious and includes superfluous information, the second may well opt to not show you all available options
